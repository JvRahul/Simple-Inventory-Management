# Simple-Inventory-Management

The code is aimed to perform the following tasks:
- Displays current Inventory on launch ( table shown below)
- Accepts an order for item and quantity from the user ( product id and qty.)
- Outputs updated inventory of items after every order.

There is a larger scope for many improvements and changes on this base project, which would be updated in the future.
